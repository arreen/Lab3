\usage{
dijkstra(graph, init_node)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A data.frame for that describes a weighted graph, a set where objects are connected to each other by a path. Each path has a distance or weight.
The data.frame must and can only contain the variables v1, v2 and w. v1 and v2 describes that there is a path between each other, while w describes the weights or distance on the specified path.}

\item{init_node}{The init_node describes the destination each node must go to. init_node must be a numeric scalar.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector with the shortest path from each node.
}
\description{
This function is a R implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm. The algorithm calculates the shortest path between a fixed node with every other node.
It does this by updating available paths, picking the nearest and unexplored nodes and updating the path distances. This goes on until all nodes are connected with the shortest path.
